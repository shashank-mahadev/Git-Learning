1. Millimeter waves
2. Small cell
3. Massive MIMO
4. Beam forming
5. Full Duplex



1. Millimeter waves :
Currently we are operating between 3GHz - 6GHz frequency, Idea is to increase the bandwidth to 30 GHz to 300 Ghz.
but there is complication in doing so, this dont travel very far and  the waves dont get around the obstacles(trees, building, clouds, rain) very well.
to address this we use 2nd tech


2. Small Cell :
Its like a mini base stations, acts as relays to get the signals around obstacles. As you find obstacles you will be
routed to other relay tat has clear view

3. Massive MIMO (Multi I/O Multi O/P :
today's 4G stations has about 12 (dozen) ports to handle internet traffic. Massive MIMO can support upto 100 ports to
handle traffic, of course this will have downside of network interference

4. Beam forming :
Traffic signalling system, sends data to specific user and avoids interfearence

5. Full Duplex
Todays services handles mostly 1 service at a time (receive / transmit) called resiprosity , so till now they use to put
the data trains either in different frequencies,  the now the solution is that they have found silicon transistors tat
acts as signalling system tat route trains tat pass each other without interferance


5G service verticals
- Enhanced mobile Broadband (eMBB) --> concentrates more on bandwidth (20GBPS) atleast 100 MBPS per customer
- Massive Machine type communication (mMTC) --> 10^6 subs per sqkm
- Ultra reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) ---> Highly reliable, low latency (1ms)


Network slicing 5G :
Even with the Huge Speeds of the internet, its difficult to provide same amount of speed for every end user. Even if we
provide they may not use it and the bandwidth will be wasted. So in order streamline the usage needs and provide
effecient services we use network slicing.
