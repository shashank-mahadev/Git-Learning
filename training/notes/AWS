AWS:

1. Virtualization types - HVM and paravirtualized
HVM(Hardware Virtual machine) - mimics OS on bare metal,
PV - is the lighter form of the virtualization, these type require modification in order to transfer the drivers to the OS level


2. Root device types: EBS and Instance storage.
EBS - connected by the network, this is remotely stored and are persistent, also scalable
Instance storage - Block based storage that comes with the system and are non-persistent, these are faster.

3. Instance types :
General Purpose- The most popular; used for web servers, development environments, etc.
Compute Optimized- Good for compute-intensive applications such as some scientific modeling or high-performance web servers.
Memory Optimized- Used for anything that needs memory-intensive applications, such as real-time big data analytics, or running Hadoop or Spark.
Accelerated Computing- Include additional hardware (GPUs, FPGAs) to provide massive amounts of parallel processing for tasks such as graphics processing.
Storage Optimized- Ideal for tasks that require huge amounts of storage, specifically with sequential read-writes, such as log processing.

4. IAM :
access management syatem accross  AWS services, can be integrated with windows AD
there are 4 key concepts - Users, Group, Roles, Policies - allow/ deny the permision for resources
USE LEAST PRIVILEGE MODEL


AWS storage services:
# EBS
# S3 glasier - We can Archive data, Cheap data, High latency, Huge data,
# Elastic File system - EFS (sharable)
# Storage Gateway -
# snowball -



5. S3 : simple storage system
Durable 99.999%, use checksum. can store anyware and anything. cost effecient, scalable. frequent access unlike glacier
Buckets and objects
versioning - same name files different versions
CRR- cross region replication
storage class -- standard, glacier, etc


It has a REST interface and uses secure HMAC-SHA1 authentication keys
secure aws data using , AES-256 Encryption and AWS-KMS (topcat)
# aws s3 ls
# aws s3 mb
# aws s3 rm
# aws s3 mv
# aws s3 cp



Volume types:
root Volume -- General purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD ( Used for IOPS intensive workloads), magnetic
EBS volume -- General purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, throughput optimized, cold HDD (when tread is less and write operation is high)

Difference between IOPS and throughput :
Throughput is rate of data transfer, like internet speed.
IOPS is the rate to perform I/O operation, like actually write the data on the disk


AWS Hypervisors:
1. Nitro -- KVM  -- from C5 - better security
2. XEN -- PV --

Amazon Route 53:
Domain Name System (DNS) - translates names to IP. It routes users to internet apps. this can be integrates different AWS services.
this can also be used with non AWS resources. Failover mechanism to route to different location end point, 100 % availability
scalable, reliable, secure, geo-location routing (customize content), geo-proximity (routing based on users and their location, bias)
latency based routing- redicrect to resource with less latency
multivalue answer routing- fetch requests on distributed systems
weighted routing - load balancing
Health checks -
we can access Route 53 -- console, API, SDK, CLI


integrated with IAM





AMI : Azure Machine Images


Cloud front : Geo Targeting -- customization based on regions

Snowball - application that enables you to transfer terabytes of data inside and outside of the AWS environment
Key-Pairs in AWS - Key-Pairs are secure login information for your Virtual Machines. To connect to the instances, you can use Key-Pairs which contain a Public Key and a Private Key.
Subnets - You can have 200 Subnets per VPC.
